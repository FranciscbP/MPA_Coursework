# Mobile Platform Applications Coursework  (2022)

Restaurants are one of the most common, if not the most common, businesses today, and it's surprising that, despite modern technology, calling some restaurants to reserve a table is still necessary.
The proposal for this project is to develop an app that allows consumers to check which restaurants are open and make reservations without having to call the establishment.
After the user logs in to the app, it will display the available restaurants, and when he clicks on the restaurant he desires, it will provide some information about the restaurant as well as the option to reserve a table with the desired date, hour and the number of people. 
The restaurant manager will be notified of the reservation and will have the option of accepting it or declining it as well as assigning a table number to it.
The manager will also have the ability to state that the restaurant is completely booked, in which case the app will not allow you to reserve another table for that day.
